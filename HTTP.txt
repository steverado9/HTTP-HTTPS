In 1989, Tim Berners lee invented HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).
HTML won't do much if we couldn't fetch data from around the world.
Tim also built the HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

HTTP: This is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources.
With the use of Http and html, we now have the www(world wide web).
http paved the way for something called the client server protocol, 
which means requests are initiated by the recipient(the browser) in http and the server now understands what it is
saying cos it is in http and now send back a response in html which the browser understands cos it is also speaking 
in http.
Http is a common Language that a client(browser) and a server use to communicate.
The messages sent by a client are usually 'rquest' and the messages sent by the server are usually called 'response'.
since http is a language, let's learn a few words
1)GET: This means i want to get an html file.
2)POST: This means i want to post something.
3)PUT: This means i want to send some data to the server and update the info on the server(edit).
4)DELETE: This means delete a piece of data on the server.

What does the server responds with?
1)http message: That is number codes like 200, 404, 501 etc.
2)Some sort of data like html etc.

How to send info to the srever other than using url
1)Query string: we use a get request eg when we submit a form.
2)through the body of the request: we use a post request.

    HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol secure)
This means the communication between the browser and the server is now encrypted.
Meaning only the client and the server knows the secrete key to read the message.
The 's' use Secure sockets layer(SSL) or Transport layer security(TLS)
Tip: Make sure there's HTTPS whenever you are loggining to something, if no htts, it is not secure

    Json(Javascript object notation)
When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be a text.
Json is text, written with Javascript object notation. 
Json is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
is json the only way to store and exchange data, No
Json can be read by any language.

Javascript comes with it's own json function
1)json.parse(): converts json to Javascript object.
2)json.stringify(): converts Javascript object to Json.

    Ajax
This allows you to read from a web server after the page has loaded and update the web page without reloading
and send data in the background while the user is still interacting with the website.
Ajax allows web applications to change content dynamically.
Ajax uses the fetch() method to make an ajax request
Ajax is a combination of tools: fetch(), https and json

    Promises
Promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future.
A promise may be in one of 3 states
1)pending
2)fulfilled
3)rejcted
Promises serve the same purpose as callbacks
